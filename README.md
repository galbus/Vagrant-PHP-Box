#Â Vagrant PHP Box

A Vagrantfile & Puppet manifest that will set you up with:

* Apache
* MySQL
* PHP

## Using the Git Submodule

First, **make sure any [System Prerequisites](#system-prerequisites) are satisfied** (see below).

    mkdir ~/Sites/project
    cd ~/Sites/project
    git submodule add git://github.com/galbus/Vagrant-PHP-Box.git vagrant
    git submodule update
    cd vagrant
    vagrant up

### Config Files

The VM and LAMP comfiguration can be changed by editing the config files below.

After any editing use `vagrant reload` (or `vagrant destroy` followed by `vagrant up`) to bring the VM back up with the new settings.

#### Vagrantfile

`Vagrantfile`

The Vagrantfile is mainly used to set the VM URL, hostname and VM params (e.g. memory) as well as set the Puppet file paths.

#### Puppet Manifest

`puppet/manifests/site.pp`

The Puppet files deal with the installation of Apache, MySQL and PHP and any other other terminal commands that are applied to the VM when it is set up.

#### Virtual Hosts

`puppet/manifests/vhosts/app.local.pp`

To add more vhosts simply drop more `*.pp` files into this directory.

## System Prerequisites

Instructions for installing required programs on OSX Mountain Lion.

### XCode & Command Line Tools

* Install XCode from App Store
* Install Command Line Tools using `XCode > Preferences > Downloads`

### RVM

OSX comes it's own copy of Ruby but we really want to leave this alone and use RVM.

1. Install RVM

        curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

2. Verify RVM install

        rvm --version

3. Install Ruby

        rvm install 2.1.0

  **If you get brew errors** then run the following (instructions from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14539521) and [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11706900))

      sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/include
      sudo chgrp -R admin /usr/local
      sudo chmod -R g+rwx /usr/local
      sudo chmod -R o-w /usr/local
      brew update
      brew doctor

4. Close and reopen all Terminal windows
   
5. Set default Ruby version

        rvm --default use 2.1.0

6. Verify Ruby version

        ruby -v

### VirtualBox

VirtualBox 4.2 is required!

Download this version from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_4_2.

### Vagrant

Download and install the latest version from http://www.vagrantup.com.

### Puppet

The Puppet site recommends installing Puppet, Facter and Hiera from packages, but I found this only caused problems across different OSX platforms.

Instead, install using:

`gem install puppet`

And it all works OK for me.

## DO NOT...

**DO NOT** `gem install vagrant`. Install the Vagrant binary from www.vagrantup.com.

**DO NOT** `gem install librarian-puppet`. The Gem install of Librarian only works with the native Puppet package - we use the Gem package due to install issues across OSX versions.
