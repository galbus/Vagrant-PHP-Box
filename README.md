#Â Vagrant PHP Box

A Vagrantfile & Puppet manifest that will set you up with:

* Apache
* MySQL
* PHP

## Installing System Prerequisites (OSX Mountain Lion)

Been here before? Installed everything you need? Then continue on to [Add as a Git Submodule](#add-as-a-git-submodule).

### XCode & Command Line Tools

* Install XCode from App Store
* Install Command Line Tools using `XCode > Preferences > Downloads`

### RVM

OSX comes it's own copy of Ruby but we really want to leave this alone and use RVM.

1. Install RVM

        curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

2. Verify RVM install

        rvm --version

  If you get an "RVM ... is already installed" message then just

        rvm reload

3. Install Ruby

        rvm install 2.1.0

  **If you get brew errors** then run the following (instructions from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14539521) and [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11706900))

      sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local/include
      sudo chgrp -R admin /usr/local
      sudo chmod -R g+rwx /usr/local
      sudo chmod -R o-w /usr/local
      brew update
      brew doctor

  Then

      rvm install 2.1.0

4. Set default Ruby version

        rvm --default use 2.1.0

5. Close and reopen all Terminal windows
   
6. Verify Ruby version

        ruby -v

### VirtualBox

An older version - VirtualBox 4.2 is required.

Download this version from https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_4_2.

### Vagrant

**DO NOT** use gem to install Vagrant!

Download the DMG and install the latest version from http://www.vagrantup.com.

### Puppet

**DO NOT** use gem to install Puppet! The Gem install of Librarian only works with the native Puppet package - we use the Gem package due to install issues across OSX versions.

The Puppet site recommends installing Puppet, Facter and Hiera from packages, but I found this only caused problems across different OSX platforms.

Instead, install using:

    gem install puppet

## Add as a Git Submodule

    cd ~/Sites/myproject
    git submodule add https://github.com/galbus/Vagrant-PHP-Box.git vagrant
    git commit -m 'commit for submodule vagrant'
    cd vagrant
    vagrant up

Next,

    sudo vi /etc/hosts

and add the following host:

    10.33.33.10 app.local

(or whatever domain(s) you are using if you're using custom Puppet manifests - see [Puppet Manifests](#puppet-manifests) below)

Assuming that your DocumentRoot is `/public/`, your site will now be available under e.g. http://app.local.

If required, the DocumentRoot and other VM/LAMP settings can be adjusted in the config files...

_(Use_ `vagrant reload` _after changing any settings)_

### Vagrantfile

`Vagrantfile`

The Vagrantfile is mainly used to set the VM URL, hostname and VM params (e.g. memory) as well as set the Puppet file paths.

### Puppet Manifests

1. The default file at `puppet/manifests/site.pp` deals with the installation of Apache, MySQL and PHP and any other other terminal commands that are applied to the VM during provisioning.
2. The default file at `puppet/manifests/vhosts/app.local.pp` creates a single vhost accessible under http://app.local.

These default files can be overridden by copying the puppet directory into the project root (one level above). e.g:

    cp -r puppet ../puppet

Now you can add specific packages or versions at `../puppet/manifests/site.pp` or you could e.g. add multiple files at `../puppet/manifests/vhosts/` to set up multiple Virtual Hosts.

## TODO

Add support for...

1. Different DocumentRoot directories (currently only /public is supported)
2. CentOS/RHEL (e.g. use yum instead of apt-get)
3. MySQL schema import on provisioning
4. MySQL updates
5. Use YAML config file instead of editing Vagrantfile and site.pp
6. Node.js
7. Mongo/Redis
8. Clusters
9. Support for Linux/Windows VM hosts
